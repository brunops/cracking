###Data Structures and Algorithms in Ruby
For fun and giggles, test-driven data structures and algorithms implementations in Ruby.

####Contribute? (Please do!)
Submit a pull request to:

- Make the code and test better.
- Add new implementation.

Everything must be tested, as much as possible, try to test-drive it, it's part of the fun.

File an issue to:

- Disagree with an implementation I have.
- Point out a bug in the code.
- Suggestions for specific data structure or algorithm implementation.
